A [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) template for those interested in developing
packages based on MDAnalysis. Starting repositories can be created from this template so you can focus on what's important: the science!

* [Cookiecutter](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Usage

With [`cookiecutter` installed](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#install-cookiecutter),
execute the following command inside the folder you want to create the skeletal repository. Follow the prompts or hit enter for the default options.

```bash
cookiecutter gh:MDAnalysis/cookiecutter-mdakit
```

Please see our documentation for more details on how to use the cookiecutter.
