Test MDAKit Project with dependencies using condaforge and ReadTheDocs

TestMDAKit_with_host_other_condaforge-deps_and_ReadTheDocs is bound by a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/other/mdakit-Cookie/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Installation

To build TestMDAKit_with_host_other_condaforge-deps_and_ReadTheDocs from source,
we highly recommend using virtual environments.
If possible, we strongly recommend that you use
[Anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) as your package manager.
Below we provide instructions both for `conda` and
for `pip`.

#### With conda

Ensure that you have [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) installed.

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```
conda create --name mdakit-Cookie
conda activate mdakit-Cookie
```

Install the development and documentation dependencies:

```
conda env update --name mdakit-Cookie --file devtools/conda-envs/test_env.yaml
conda env update --name mdakit-Cookie --file docs/requirements.yaml
```

Build this package from source:

```
pip install -e .
```

If you want to update your dependencies (which can be risky!), run:

```
conda update --all
```

And when you are finished, you can exit the virtual environment with:

```
conda deactivate
```

#### With pip

To build the package from source, run:

```
pip install .
```

If you want to create a development environment, install
the dependencies required for tests and docs with:

```
pip install ".[test,doc]"
```
