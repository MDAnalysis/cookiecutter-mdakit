Cookiecutter for MDAnalysis-based packages
==========================================


A `cookiecutter <https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter>`_ template for those interested in developing packages
based on MDAnalysis. Skeletal starting repositories can be created from this template to create the
file structure semi-autonomously so you can focus on what's important: the science!

The skeletal structure is designed to help you get started, but do not feel limited by the skeleton's features
included here.
